# thin-krnl
Some sort of kernel for x86 processors. The goal is to have a system that feels like the Commodore 64, allowing random access and jumping to memory, as well as requiring hard work to implement basic drivers.  
Please do not try running this for real, as there are zero protections put in place. I do not take responsibility for any harm done to your files, memory, CPU, etc. because you did not heed these warnings. No warranty included.
